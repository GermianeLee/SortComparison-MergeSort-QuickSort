The SortComparison.java program is designed to evaluate and compare the performance of two sorting algorithmsâ€”MergeSort and QuickSort.
It runs both algorithms on the same datasets, measuring factors such as execution time and efficiency to determine which algorithm completes
the sorting process faster. By analyzing these results, the program provides insights into how each algorithm performs under different conditions,
helping to identify the most suitable sorting method for a given type or size of data.
